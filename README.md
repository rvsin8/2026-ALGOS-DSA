This repository is my **Algorithms & Data Structures Prep for 2026** and a place where I consistently practice problem solving because I genuinely enjoy it.

I use this repo to:
- Build strong fundamentals in DSA (arrays, intervals, heaps, graphs, DP, etc.)
- Practice writing **clean, interview-ready Java Python JavaScript solutions**
- Learn common patterns through repetition (greedy, two pointers, sweep line, priority queues)
- Improve reasoning, edge-case handling, and clarity under pressure

I enjoy working through problems, understanding *why* solutions work and tightening my thinking over time.

### Structure
- Problems are grouped by topic (Arrays, Graphs, Strings, Tries, etc.)
- Solutions prioritize correctness, readability, and simplicity
- Code reflects learning in progress and iteration, not perfection

This repo is meant to show **consistent practice, problem-solving discipline, and growth** over time.
